## Running Locally

As this is a static website, you can run it using any simple local server. A common way is with the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code.

1.  Open the `learning-site` directory in VS Code.
2.  Install the **Live Server** extension if you haven't already.
3.  Right-click on `public/index.html` in the file explorer.
4.  Select "Open with Live Server".

This will open the site in your default browser and automatically reload when you save changes to the files.
